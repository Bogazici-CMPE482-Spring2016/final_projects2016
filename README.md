CMPE 482 Final Projects, by Ali Caner Turkmen.

- In the first file `project1.ipynb`, we provide answers to the first project assignment. 
- In the second file, `project2.ipynb`, we perform spectral clustering for the second project. We also extract the kernel calculation to Cython to speed things up over 1000x times.
- Having gotten Cython into the mix, we take the time to present a short tutorial on Cython, in `Cython.ipynb`.
